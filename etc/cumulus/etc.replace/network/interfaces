# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).
#
# IMPORTANT!!!!!!!
#
# Interface definitions are processed in an order dependent fashion as follows:
#
# - Loopbacks, ports, and bonds such as lo, swp12, bond0
#   - note that ports that are part of a bond do not have other configuration
# - Port and bond sub-interfaces (vlans), such as swp1.900 or bond0.100
# - Bridges, like br0 and br2.
#
# When defining more than 10 bridges using VLAN sub-interfaces, the
# subinterfaces should be declared in conjunction with their associated bridge.
#

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
#auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
