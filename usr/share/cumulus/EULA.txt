    	3. Price; Payment; Records. 
    a. During the term of this Agreement, Licensee may place requests for additional Purchased Licenses by submitting orders to either Cumulus or an Authorized Reseller.  Cumulus or the Authorized Reseller will respond with a formalized and accepted order confirming the number of Purchased Licenses, the License Term, the total price, and any taxes due (each such form, an "Order Confirmation").  Each Order Confirmation is hereby incorporated into this Agreement in its entirety. Each Purchased License set forth on an Order Confirmation shall enable Licensee to create a single copy of the Product and use the copy of the Product in accordance with the License Grant set forth in Section 2. 
    b. During the term of this Agreement, Licensee shall be entitled to buy 12-month Purchased Licenses in accordance with the Order Confirmations delivered by Cumulus to Licensee (exclusive of taxes, if any).  Order Confirmations for additional licenses will incorporate an extension License Term for all existing Purchased Licenses under this agreement so that after the Order Confirmation, the License Term for all Purchased Licenses will end on the date that is the end of the 12-month period for the additional licenses being purchased.  Extension License Terms will be priced on a daily pro-rata basis calculated as the Purchase License price set forth on the Order Confirmation divided by 365 for each day of extension.  
    c. Licensee will pay to Cumulus all applicable fees set forth in each Order Confirmation (the "Fees") within thirty (30) days of receipt of each Order Confirmation.

Unless explicitly identified as Taxes on the Order Confirmation, all amounts due are exclusive of taxes, withholding, duties, levies, tariffs, and other governmental charges (including without limitation VAT), excluding taxes on Cumulus's net income (collectively, "Taxes"), and Licensee is responsible for payment of all Taxes. The parties will reasonably cooperate to lawfully minimize Taxes.  In the event Licensee does not pay Cumulus any portion of the Fees when due, Licensee shall also pay Cumulus a late payment fee in the amount of 1.5% of the total amount outstanding per month for the period any such Fees are delinquent.  
    d.  During the Term of this Agreement and for one (1) year following its termination, Licensee will create and maintain records regarding Licensee's use of the Product, which records shall include, without limitation, each installation of a copy of the Product and a unique identifier for the hardware where it is installed (collectively, "Records"). At Cumulus's request, Licensee will promptly provide such Records to Cumulus for the purpose of verifying compliance with this Agreement. In the event that Licensee fails to create, maintain or deliver Records as required under this Section or in the event of any dispute as to the accuracy of such Records, Cumulus may audit Licensee's use of the Product (e.g., via review of copies of applicable log files, etc.), at any location in which the Product is or has been installed or otherwise utilized by Licensee.
    	4. Delivery and Support.
    a. After delivery of the first Order Confirmation under this Agreement, Cumulus will promptly deliver to Licensee one copy of the Product in executable form.
    b. Unless contractually or legally prohibited from doing so, Cumulus will provide Licensee at no cost with updates and new releases of the Product that it makes generally commercially available to Cumulus's customers in connection with its lowest list price, provided Licensee has one or more Purchased Licenses that are in good standing under this Agreement.  
    	5. Publicity; Agreement Disclosure; Trademarks. 
    a. Cumulus shall have the right to reference Licensee as a customer without disclosing the terms of this Agreement.

    b. Except as otherwise specified herein, neither party may use any of the other party's trademarks and service marks ("Marks") except in accordance with written (including electronic communications) approval of the other party.  Licensee grants Cumulus a limited license to use Licensee's Marks in accordance with Licensee's Marks usage guidelines for the sole purpose of identifying Licensee as a customer.  The parties will not otherwise use or register (or make any filing with respect to) the other party's Marks anywhere in the world.  Neither party will contest anywhere in the world the use by or authorization by the other party of any of such party's Marks.  No other right or license with respect to any trademark, tradename, or other designation is granted under this Agreement.
   	6. Prohibition Against Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any rights, licenses or obligations hereunder, may be assigned by either party without the prior written approval of the non-assigning party; any prohibited purported assignment shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may assign this Agreement or delegate its rights and obligations to any acquirer of all or of substantially all of such party's assets or business or equity securities pertaining to the subject matter of this Agreement, provided however, that in the event of any such assignment, upon receipt of notice of assignment, the non-assigning party shall have a period of thirty days to terminate this Agreement upon written notice. 
   	7. Term of Agreement. The term of this Agreement shall run until expired as set forth in the last to expire valid electronic license file you receive from Cumulus or Cumulus's authorized reseller (the "Initial Term").  At the end of the then current Term, unless written notice of intention not to renew is delivered by one party to the other party on or before thirty (30) days before the end of the Term, the Agreement shall automatically renew for an additional one year term (each a "Renewal Term" and collectively with the "Initial Term" the "Term").  This Agreement may be terminated if either party materially fails to perform or comply with this Agreement or any material provision hereof. Termination shall be effective thirty (30) days after notice of termination to the defaulting party if the defaults have not been cured within such thirty (30) day period.  
    	8. Survival. Rights to payment, Sections 1, 2(b-e), 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 14 and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any right of action for breach of this Agreement prior to termination shall survive any termination of this Agreement.  In the event of termination for Cumulus's breach, all Purchased Licenses shall survive termination until the end of the applicable License Term.  In the event of termination for Licensee's breach, all Purchased Licenses shall immediately terminate. 
    	9. Notices and Requests. All notices, consents, authorizations, and requests in connection with this Agreement shall be deemed given immediately after they are sent by air express courier, charges prepaid; and addressed with Attention to the Legal Department to the applicable address set forth in the most recent Order Confirmation governed by this Agreement or to such other address as the party to receive the notice or request so designates by written notice under this Section 9 to the other.
    	10. Controlling Law; Attorney's Fees. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of California and the United States without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions and without regard to UCITA or the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. The sole jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter hereof shall be the California state and U.S. federal courts in Santa Clara County, California. Both parties consent to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts and agree that process may be served in the manner provided herein for giving of notices or otherwise as allowed by California or federal law.  The prevailing party in any dispute shall be entitled to recover its reasonable costs attorneys' fees, and other expenses. 
    	11. Confidentiality
The pricing terms of this Agreement, the Product and underlying inventions, algorithms, know-how and ideas are Cumulus's Proprietary Information. Except as expressly and unambiguously allowed herein, Licensee will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any Proprietary Information and its employees and contractors will be similarly bound in writing.  Nothing herein shall permit the receiving party to disclose or use, except as explicitly permitted elsewhere in this Agreement, confidential information of the disclosing party and then only on an "as-needed" basis for purposes of this Agreement.  Upon any termination of this Agreement, Licensee will promptly return or destroy any Proprietary Information and any copies, extracts and derivatives thereof, except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement.  Additionally, Licensee will promptly delete any and all copies of the Product i) as soon as the applicable Purchased License expires with respect to that copy of the Product; and ii) prior to any distribution of hardware where the Product is installed to any third party, including a hardware reseller or manufacturer.  Each party acknowledges that its breach of this Section 11 would cause irreparable injury to the other for which monetary damages are not an adequate remedy. Accordingly, a party will be entitled to seek injunctions and other equitable remedies in the event of such a breach by the other.
    	12. Limited Liability. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED BELOW, AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE IN THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE OR OBLIGATED UNDER ANY SECTION OF THIS AGREEMENT OR UNDER CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (A) FOR ANY AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE AGGREGATE OF THE LICENSE FEES PAID TO IT (IN THE CASE OF CUMULUS) OR (IN THE CASE OF LICENSEE) PAID OR OWED BY IT HEREUNDER, OR (B) ANY INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS (EXCEPT AMOUNTS PAYABLE UNDER SECTION 3) OR LOST OR CORRUPTED DATA OR INTERRUPTED USE OR (C) COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS, TECHNOLOGY OR SERVICES. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 12 SHALL NOT APPLY TO BREACHES OF SECTIONS 2(b-e) AND 11 OR TO ACTIONS OF LICENSEE BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE LICENSE GRANT HEREUNDER. 
    	13. Warranty and Indemnity. 
    a. Cumulus warrants to Licensee that the Product will be of good quality and developed using good workmanship in accordance with the highest professional standards. Licensee's sole remedy for breach of this warranty or for product defects is its rights under Section 4(b). Cumulus makes no warranty regarding freedom from bugs or uninterrupted use.
    b. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH ABOVE, CUMULUS MAKES NO WARRANTIES TO ANY PERSON OR ENTITY WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCT AND DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
    c. EACH PARTY RECOGNIZES AND AGREES THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIABILITY AND REMEDY LIMITATIONS IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE MATERIAL BARGAINED FOR BASES OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AND REFLECTED IN DETERMINING THE CONSIDERATION TO BE GIVEN BY EACH PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND IN THE DECISION BY EACH PARTY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.
    	14. General. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and merges all prior and contemporaneous communications. It shall not be modified except by a written agreement dated subsequent to the date of this Agreement and signed on behalf of Licensee and Cumulus by their duly authorized representatives.  If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.  No waiver of any breach of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any prior, concurrent or subsequent breach of the same or any other provisions hereof, and no waiver shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party.
